                <div class="half-width">
                  <p>Finding a good cover photo is really important for you page because it is one of the first things people see when they visit you page. It is important that the cover page serves a purpose. Facebook even allows you to have a cover video for your page and that can be useful in showing how your company works. Another thing to think about when selecting a cover picture is that you can also use it to advertise things for your company or just show what your company does. Take this page as an example:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="half-width">
                   <p>On this Facebook page, the company has chosen a visually appealing cover image that also advertises one of the main services they offer: the ballroom they have for individuals to rent. The image captures your attention and makes you want to learn more about the event center.</p>

               <p><strong><i>Keep You Captions Short & Sweet</i></strong><br>
                 Instagram users aren’t online to read a ton of written content. Instagram is all about the visuals. While it’s important to compliment your photo with a caption that promotes your company and the services you provide, you should do that as simply as possible. Consider this post by Harley Davidson on Instagram:</p>

                 <!--- Assign it a class change font & color -->
                 <p><font size = "3"color = "black"><i>This is an example of designing content for Instagram well. It features a strong photo with a short caption that captures what the Harley Davidson brand is all about: “Go solo in style”. It’s short and sweet, but it’s still promoting the brand and the products it offers.</i></font></p>
