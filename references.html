              <p><font size = "2" color = "black">“I’ll be honest, this project was my least favorite part of the class. I didn’t anticipate having to do this kind of thing when I signed up for the course and I can’t imagine ever doing it again in my life. However, It was interesting to be able to pull knowledge from other fields (marketing and social media design) and relate that back to digital writing environments. Social media is a huge part of the digital writing landscape now and it was valuable to analyze it more critically.”</font></p>

                <p><font size = "2" color = "black">"This was a pretty interesting and challenging project. I haven't done web development in a while, so this was a great opportunity to improve, as well as learn new things about HTML & CSS.
                  I didn't realize how important and impactful social media was before working on this assignment. I hope whoever reads and utilizes our website in the future will learn just as much as I did on this topic!"</font></p>

              <li>Jordin</li>
              <p><font size = "2" color = "black">“Working on this web page has helped me learned the process that goes through working with a team in order to make sure that the website has the best quality and also has helped me to
                gain more knowledge on many different aspects. The website we made more specifically has also opened my eyes on how much of an impact that social media has on marketing and how important it is today to utilize all types of social media. ”</font></p>

              <li>Savan</li>
              <p><font size = "2" color = "black">“While working on this Web page I learned so many different things about marketing while using social media. One of the interesting things that I learned were the design aspects that go into marketing. For example, on Facebook choosing a good cover photo really makes a difference and it helps attract more attention to your page. For instagram, having good high quality pictures is something that I never thought about that helps with marketing as well. I really enjoyed working with this group, they were all so helpful with figuring out what content needed to be added to the webpage. Everyone was very understanding and accommodating with our crazy work schedules.”</font></p>

              <li>Sarah</li>
              <p><font size = "2" color = "black">“Working on this web page and in a group setting in this class was very beneficial. I got to see how other people respond to social media and how marketing on social media affects them. We learned why social media marketing is leading the pack in the new ways of advertising online. Social media marketing is so popular due the fact that it is free and ability for companies to create sticky content on social media very easily. Group work usually is not my favorite thing in the world because of back and forth arguing, but there was not any of that in the group and we worked very well together.”</font></p>
